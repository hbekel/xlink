These files come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

These gerber files SHOULD work for most manufacturers. However, you
always need to make sure that the files you commit into production
comply with the requirements of your chosen manufacturer. The
manufacturer SHOULD state their requirements for gerber files on their
website.

To recreate these files with different parameters, open the pcb file
in KiCAD's Pcbnew application and choose File -> Plot.

Always use KiCAD's GerbView application to review the gerber files and
the drill file prior to ordering pcbs.
